## Categorical Jacobian from ESM2
This subfolder is an adaptation of [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabBio/blob/main/categorical_jacobian/esm2.ipynb) from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2406285121).

This jupyter notebook lets you run the same workflow locally (e.g., when you don't have enough GPU access on Colab). If Colab runs for you, using the original Colab is likely easier and cleaner.
